# Corona

A exploratry project to build a lighter, simpler Java IDE - or learn trying!

Many IDEs try to handle many languages and a large range of features. Corona's aim is to present the most important tools and allow developer's to simply focus on writing things.

In short: `The'I' in IDE should also stand for "invisible"`

## Contributing

Corona is currently in the data-gathering phase of development. We welcome any use cases and feature suggestions!

As we are just beginning, the main focus is intended to be on tools and features which have a significant impact on the ability of developers to smoothly go about doing what needs doing
